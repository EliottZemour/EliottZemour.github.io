This page regroups two projects I carried out for the Mathematical Modeling of Behavior course at EPFL, during my master studies.  

The goal was to develop a discrete choice model for analyzing the transportation mode choice behavior of individuals living in the London metropolitan area, by using the London Passenger Mode Choice (LPMC) dataset.
